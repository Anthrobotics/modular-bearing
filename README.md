# improved-modular-bearing
A lightweight, customizable and parametric bearing manufacturable using 3D printing and CNC machining.

# Description
The improved modular bearing (IMB) is designed as an alternative for non-replaceable (or difficult to replace) bearings in robotic joints and actuators. The IMB is customized using an OpenSCAD generator, and can be used in a wide number of designs. It can be swapped out without requiring any tools, depending on how it is integrated into a design.

# Specifications
The following parameters of the IMB can be customized:
- Outer diameter (OD)
- Inner diameter (ID)
- Width
- Number of rolling elements
- Diameter of rolling elements
- Spacing of rolling elements in cage
- Tolerances of rolling and sliding surfaces
- Chamfer of rolling elements
- Inner and outer screw hole diameter
- Inner and outer screw hole count
- Edge distance of screw holes
- Optional secondary screw holes

# Testing
Rotation tests have been performed by hand on the IMB, demonstrating smooth motion. Testing with the WOLF actuator will be conducted soon.

# Bill of Materials
You will need the following:

Printed components:
- 1x inner ring
- 1x cage
- 1x outer ring, lower
- 1x outer ring, upper
- rolling elements (number will vary)

COTS components:
The number and quantity of commercial fasteners will vary depending on the configuration of the bearing. The following components are recommended for use with the IMB:
- roll pins (to secure the outer ring halves togetehr)
- countersunk bolts, to attach the bearing

Tools:
- 3D printer
- Tweezers (to assist with bearing assembly)
- PTFE lubricant (Super-Lube) for bearign races and rolling elements

# Assembly Guide
Coming soon.

# Usage
The IMB can be integrated into a number of designs, including:
- robotic joints
- actuators
- motion platforms
